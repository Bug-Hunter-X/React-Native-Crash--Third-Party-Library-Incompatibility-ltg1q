The solution involves identifying the incompatible library.  Check the library's documentation for compatibility with your React Native version.  Update the library to the latest version using npm or yarn:
npm install <library_name>@latest
or
yarn upgrade <library_name>
If updating isn't possible (e.g., the library is no longer maintained), consider finding an alternative library with similar functionality. If dependency conflicts exist, resolve them by carefully examining your `package.json` and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` files, ensuring that all dependencies are compatible.  Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why <library_name>` to analyze the dependency tree and pinpoint conflicts.
