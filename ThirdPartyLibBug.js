This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that isn't compatible with the current version of React Native or has conflicting dependencies.  For example, using an outdated library might cause unexpected behavior or runtime errors. The code might compile, but the app crashes during runtime or behaves unexpectedly.  This often manifests as a generic error, such as `undefined is not an object` or a similar message not directly indicating the incompatibility.
